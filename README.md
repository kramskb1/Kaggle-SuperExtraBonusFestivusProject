	A Python flask powered API with at least two routes was created. At least one route was dynamic. At least two plotly javascript visualizations that read data from the API routes that I created were created. A basic HTML page that displays my rendered visualizations was created. My app was deployed to Heroku.
	In my app.py file, a route for a prediction for passenger representation was created. Another route for a prediction of a passengerâ€™s survival chance was created. A route for the index was created. A route for what made up the prediction was created. A route for the predictors was created. A route for the survival chance was created.
	Data was converted into a dataframe in my app.py file. A model was created based on predictions in my app.py file. My output was generated. Data was returned. RandomForestClassifier, GaussianNB, GradientBoostingClassifier, and DecisionTreeClassifier were all imported but were not used as much as I initially expected them to be used. Pickle was imported and used to load the model.
	In my Jupyter Notebook Python file, I first looked at the model score. This represents how accurate the model is. I then looked at the head of my data. I then looked at percentage survived by passenger class. Next, the number survived by sex and the number survived by age were examined. The number survived by the number of siblings and spouses on board was examined. A description of the test.csv dataset was generated. A Heroku URL dashboard was generated.
	The app on my Heroku account was generated in benpipeline as peaceful-sands-08242. Logplex was enabled. The full stack Flask app was deployed using Heroku. Using Heroku is something that may be very important for me in the future. This assignment helped introduce me on how to use Heroku.
